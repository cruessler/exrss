# ExRss

ExRss is a web-based RSS feed reader, optimized for use on mobile devices. It
is already usable, but lacks features and polish.

The backend is developed in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), using
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), while the frontend is written in
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org).
